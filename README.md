## Description:  

The Project is about developing an idea of using an Automatic-Frictionless Speed Braking System, as an additional Mechanism to Normal manual brakes in modern day vehicles. This type of Automatic-Frictionless Systems would help to get rid of several hazardous situations that might arise while driving in which modern day manual brakes fail to perform efficiently.     

- I have done the complete Assembly Model of the entire Design, and Rendered it too, in Catia v5.
- I have done the circuit design of the Sensing and Response system and then simulated it, in TinkerCAD.

## Software Prerequisites and Installation:  

-The product has been designed in Catia v5r21, and so all the part designs is saved as Catia's native file format(.CATPart), and the Assembly design saved as (.CATProduct).  
So to Open these Files, one must have Catia v5 pre-installed in his/her PC.  

-If anyone has CAD softwares other than Catia v5r21, for them I have provided the (.stp) file of the Product design, so one can easily open and view the model by opening the (.stp) files in his/her CAD software.  

-One can simulate the "Obstacle detection and Responce" Program if he/she has a TinkerCAD account; By designing the circuit as shown in the Image, and then running the code.

## Aim and Objective of the Project:  

In the rapidly changing world, the speed has become an important factor in human’s life. Everyone wants to get fast as much as possible. In the fast speed world, there are two perspectives, one is keeping speed and another is to maintain safety mediums as well. So keeping speed is quite easy for a person and in case of safety mediums, there must be a lot of attention.  
The Automatic Frictionless Braking System will serve as a major step to keep up with the pace of human life, with both speed and safety.   
- This type of Braking Mechanism will help to overcome various problem, that the people faces using the modern day manual brakes(details of the project written in the .PDF file attatched).
